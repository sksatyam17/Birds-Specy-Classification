Bird Species Identification Using Deep Learning
Identifying and classifying rare bird species is a challenging task due to the wide variety of sizes, shapes, colors, and angles at which birds can be observed. Visual identification, particularly through images, is often more intuitive than audio classification, but it comes with its own set of complexities due to significant variations in appearance.

To tackle this challenge, we utilize the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 [CUB-200-2011] dataset for training and testing our model. Our approach employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), implemented with TensorFlow, to convert images into grayscale and generate autographs. These autographs are then used to create multiple comparison nodes, enhancing the accuracy of species identification.

By building a comprehensive database of standard image features for various bird species and applying a similarity comparison algorithm, our system has shown promising results in practical applications.
